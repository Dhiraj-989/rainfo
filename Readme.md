# RAINFO – Rainfall Prediction System 🌧️

This project was developed during a research internship at DRDO (PXE) in 2025. RAINFO is a machine learning-based system that predicts the occurrence and intensity of rainfall using meteorological data.

## 📌 Features
- Predicts whether it will rain tomorrow (classification)
- Visualizations for feature analysis and evaluation
- Multiple ML models tested and compared (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, CatBoost etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Results
- Achieved ~85% accuracy on classification models
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix

##  Team
This was a collaborative project done with 4 members during our internship.
